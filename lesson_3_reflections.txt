When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use a remote repository when you will be working from different computers, for example, a home computer and a work computer.
Or, use a remote repository when you're working with a team and mulitple people will be committing to the project. 
A remote repository would also be useful when you want to keep a backup of your work for any reason, or if you want to make your 
project available to others to use. Very useful!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your work may not automatically work smoothly with updates on the remote, so best to have the control
to choose if and when you pull the latest from remote.
