When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Use a remote repository when you will be working from different computers, for example, a home computer and a work computer.
Or, use a remote repository when you're working with a team and mulitple people will be committing to the project. 
A remote repository would also be useful when you want to keep a backup of your work for any reason, or if you want to make your 
project available to others to use. Very useful!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your work may not automatically work smoothly with updates on the remote, so best to have the control
to choose if and when you pull the latest from remote. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is when you copy someone else's repository to your github account. You make a fork on the github site itself. 
A clone is when you make a local copy of a repository on github (although you can also make a copy of a local repository). 
A branch is when you want to work on a specific aspect or feature of your current project. 
Use forking when you want to make your own changes to someone else's public repository.
Use clone when you want to contribute to someone else's repository, or when you want to store your repository on github
and work on it locally. 
Use branch when you want to try a special feature or a particular bug fix on your current
project.
