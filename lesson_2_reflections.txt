What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository in a directory with git init, git creates a new directory titled .git. This dir contains repo history. You must create the first commit. 
If you don't git init, git won't know that it needs to track history. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a snapshot of what's ready for commit. Working directory is always in flux and being operated on, as opposed to a snapshot.
The repository is a final snapshot. Staging area allows you to group like changes together in a single commit. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can run git add only on the change you want to commit. Then you can run git diff --staged (I think) to compare staged to most recent commit. This should only show the logical change that you want to encapsulate in a single commit. 
Finally, git commit will commit the single logical change.
